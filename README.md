# Music Genre Classification Project

Our project is aimed at developing a neural network capable of accurately classifying music based on its genre. The goal is to streamline the process of organizing Spotify songs by creating genre-specific playlists. To achieve this objective, we have structured our project into four primary stages, each comprising several sub-stages. 

## 1. Data Collection and Preparation

### 1.1 Data Sourcing:
We will begin by sourcing a dataset containing Spotify song statistics. This dataset will include essential features such as song-id, genre, danceability, loudness, and more. Our aim is to obtain a dataset that is both comprehensive and representative of various musical genres.

### 1.2 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Upon acquiring the dataset, we will perform thorough cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data consistency and reliability. This step involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. The goal is to prepare a clean and structured dataset ready for model training.

## 2. Integration with Personal Spotify Accounts

### 2.1 Utilizing Spotify API:
We will leverage the Spotify API to integrate our model with personal Spotify accounts. This integration will enable us to access users' liked songs playlists and retrieve additional song metadata and statistics directly from Spotify's database.

### 2.2 Playlist Management:
The integration will facilitate seamless playlist management, allowing users to create, update, and organize playlists based on their preferred genres. Users can easily sync their Spotify accounts with our system, streamlining the process of playlist curation.

## 3. Neural Network Development and Training

### 3.1 Identifying Genre Correlations:
In this phase, our objective is to develop a neural network capable of discerning correlations between Spotify statistics and music genres. For instance, songs characterized by high scores in metrics like loudness and energy may tend to belong to the "rock" genre, while those with elevated energy and danceability scores may align more closely with the "dance" genre.

### 3.2 Leveraging Song Statistics and Metadata:
Our approach involves utilizing both song statistics and metadata to enhance the model's classification accuracy. We will consider Spotify statistics such as tempo, danceability, and loudness as indicative features for genre classification. Additionally, we will incorporate metadata such as artist and album information as contextual cues, leveraging the tendency for artists to specialize in particular genres.

### 3.3 Training for Genre Discrimination:
Training the neural network entails exposing it to a diverse dataset encompassing songs from various genres. Through iterative training, the model learns to recognize and extract relevant features from the input data, refining its ability to accurately classify songs into their respective genres.

### 3.4 Evaluation and Validation:
Once trained, we will evaluate the model's performance in discriminating between different music genres. Utilizing evaluation metrics such as F1-score we will assess the model's effectiveness in generalizing genre classifications across a range of music samples. 

## 4. Creation of User-Friendly Interface

### 4.1 Interface Design and Prototyping:
We will design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with our music genre classification system. The interface will feature responsive design principles, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

### 4.2 Integration with Backend Services:
The interface will be seamlessly integrated with the backend services, allowing real-time interaction with the classification model and Spotify API. Users can easily select playlists and initiate genre-based classification with minimal effort.

### 4.3 User Customization:
Users will have the option to select specific genres of playlists they want created, even further streamlining the process of organizing their personal playlists.

## Conclusion

Through the execution of these stages, we aim to create a comprehensive music genre classification system that streamlines playlist organization on Spotify.
